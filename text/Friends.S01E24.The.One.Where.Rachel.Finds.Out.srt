1
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:04,795
Here's little Ben nodding off.

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,840
Aww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy.

3
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:11,593
- Look, he's got Ross' haircut.
- Oh, let me see.

4
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,222
Oh, God!
Is he just the sweetest thing?

5
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,475
You must just want
to kiss him all over.

6
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,481
That would be nice.

7
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,318
- Pfft.
- Pardon?

8
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,864
Nothing. Just a little extra air
in my mouth. Pfft.

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,164
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here?
I promise I'll pay you back.

10
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,417
Oh, yeah, right.
Including the waffles last week...

11
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,252
...you now owe me...

12
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,629
...17 jillion dollars.

13
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,716
I will, really,
I'll pay you back this time.

14
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,801
Where's the money coming from?

15
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,555
I'm helping out at the NYU
Med School with some, uh, research.

16
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,432
What kind of research?

17
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,394
Uh, just, you know, science.

18
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,730
Science.

19
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,984
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

20
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,780
It's a fertility study.

21
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,949
Joey...

22
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,286
Please tell me you're only
donating your time.

23
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,248
Come on, you guys.
It's not that big a deal.

24
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,210
I just go down there
every other day...

25
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,504
...and make my contribution
to the project.

26
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,674
Hey, but at the end of two weeks,
I get $700!

27
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,636
Wow, you're gonna be making money
hand over fist.

28
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,232
Okay, we got the coleslaw.
We got the buns.

29
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:34,611
We've got the ground-up flesh
of formally cute cows and turkeys.

30
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,365
Men are here!

31
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,581
We make fire.

32
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,750
Cook meat.

33
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,461
Then put out fire by peeing,
no get invited back!

34
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,589
Cute, cute.

35
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,675
- Oh, Melanie called. She's gonna be late.
- Oh, okay.

36
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,552
So how are things going with you two?

37
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,305
Is she becoming your special someone?

38
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,767
I don't know. She's, uh...
She's pretty great.

39
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,188
Yeah? What does she think of
your little science project?

40
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:14,568
You think I'm gonna tell a girl I like
that I'm also seeing a cup?

41
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,990
The man's got a point.

42
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,869
Well, the tough thing is,
she really wants to have sex with me.

43
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,288
Crazy bitch.

44
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,880
I still got a week left in the program,
and according to the rules...

45
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:39,009
...if I want to get the money, I'm not allowed
to conduct any personal experiments...

46
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,846
...if you know what I mean.
- Joey, we always know what you mean.

47
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,480
- Hey.
- Hey.

48
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,025
How long did you think
this barbecue was gonna last?

49
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,610
I'm going to China.

50
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,446
Jeez, you say one thing and, eh...

51
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,823
You're going to China?

52
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,785
It's, uh, for the museum.
Someone found a bone.

53
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,120
We want the bone,
they don't want us to have it.

54
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,458
So I'm going to try to persuade them...
It's a whole big "bone" thing.

55
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,504
Anyway, I'm gonna be gone
for, like, a week.

56
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:19,800
So, uh, if you wanna reach me,
you can't. So here's my itinerary.

57
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,718
Um...

58
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,638
- Here's a picture of me.
- Oh, let me see.

59
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:29,393
Could you take it to Carol's now and then
and show it to Ben so he doesn't forget me?

60
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,812
- Yeah.
- Hi, Ben.

61
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,981
I'm your father.

62
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,069
I am The Head! Pahh!

63
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,534
This barbecue's gonna be very fun.

64
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:50,580
Is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her
a happy birthday before I left.

65
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,001
- Oh, no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
- Oh. Heh.

66
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,961
Hey, who's Carl?

67
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,799
- The guy she met at the coffeehouse?
- No.

68
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,595
- See, there's this guy she met at...
- The coffeehouse? Right.

69
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,932
So you do know who he is. Heh.

70
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,104
I'm gonna go say goodbye
to the guys.

71
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,190
Hey, you know what?
Tell them that bone story.

72
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,405
- Hi.
- Hey.

73
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,614
Hey.

74
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,451
- I have to go to China.
- The country?

75
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,539
No, this big pile of dishes
in my Mom's breakfront.

76
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,084
Do you guys know who Carl is?

77
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,421
Let's see. Alvin, Simon, Theodore...

78
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,797
No.

79
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,801
- Well, Rachel's having drinks with him.
- Oh, no!

80
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,554
How can she, when she's never
shown interest in you?

81
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,891
Forget about her.

82
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,145
He's right, man. Please move on.
Go to China. Eat Chinese food.

83
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,190
Of course, there they just call it food.

84
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,277
Yeah? I guess. I don't know.

85
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,406
All right, just give her this
for me, okay?

86
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,450
Listen, we're just looking out for you.

87
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,160
- I know.
- We want you to be happy.

88
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,247
And I may only have a couple beers
in me, but I love you, man.

89
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,668
I'm still on my first.

90
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,298
I just think you're nice.

91
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,393
Anyway, that's when me and my friends
started this fruit-basket business.

92
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:39,189
We call ourselves
"The Three Basketeers. " Ha, ha.

93
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,275
Like "The Three Musketeers,"
only with fruit.

94
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,986
Oh!

95
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,280
Okay.

96
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,160
- How do you like your burgers?
- No. Presents first, food later!

97
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,455
Hold on there, tiger.

98
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,833
How's it going?
How you holding up?

99
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,543
Well, not so good.

100
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,130
She thinks tonight's the night
we're gonna complete the transaction...

101
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,714
...if you know what I...

102
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,383
And you do. Heh.

103
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,220
So, uh, have you ever thought about
being there for her?

104
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,222
What do you mean?

105
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,728
You know, just be there for her.

106
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,941
Not following you.

107
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,155
Think about it.

108
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:38,373
Okay, I'm guessing this is from...

109
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,170
Well, thank you, Melanie.

110
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,964
- Okay, this one right here is from me.
- Okay.

111
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,757
Hmm. Ah, it's light.

112
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,303
It rattles. It's...

113
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,600
...Travel Scrabble.
- Ha, ha, hey!

114
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:00,187
Wow. Thank you.

115
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,317
This one's from Joey.

116
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:10,405
It feels like a book. I think it's a book.
Feels like a book. And it's a book!

117
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,407
It's Dr. Seuss!

118
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,827
That book got me through
some tough times.

119
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,373
There is a little child
inside this man.

120
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,502
The doctors say if they remove it,
he'll die.

121
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,507
- Who's this from?
- That's, uh, Ross'.

122
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,966
Ah.

123
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,556
Oh, my God.

124
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,892
He remembered.

125
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,310
Remembered what?

126
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,229
It was, like, months ago.

127
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:45,941
We were walking by this antique store,
and I saw this pin in the window.

128
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,819
I told him it was just like one
my grandmother had when I was little.

129
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,365
Aw! I can't believe he remembered!

130
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:57,160
Well, sure, but can you
play it on a plane?

131
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,251
Oh, it's so pretty.

132
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,420
- This must've cost him a fortune.
- I can't believe he did this.

133
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,965
Ross? Remember when he
fell in love with Carol...

134
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:13,593
...and bought her that ridiculously
expensive crystal duck?

135
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,555
What did you just say?

136
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,026
Crystal duck.

137
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,533
No, no, no.

138
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,911
The, um... The "love" part?

139
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,379
Oh, my God.

140
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,799
Oh, no, no, no, no.

141
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,302
That's good.
Just keep rubbing your head.

142
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,971
That'll turn back time.

143
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,771
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable.

144
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,649
I know. This is really, really huge.

145
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:14,321
No, it's not. It's small,
it's tiny, it's petite, it's wee.

146
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,534
Uh-uh. I don't think any of our lives
will ever be the same ever again.

147
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,496
Is there a mute button on this woman?

148
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,125
I think this is so great!
I mean, you and Ross!

149
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,587
- Did you have any idea?
- No, none.

150
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,090
My first night in the city,
he mentioned asking me out...

151
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,760
...but nothing ever happened,
so I just...

152
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,138
What else did he say?
Does he want to go out with me?

153
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,515
Given that he's desperately
in love with you...

154
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,810
...he wouldn't mind getting
a cup of coffee or something.

155
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,771
Ross?

156
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,106
All this time?

157
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,692
- I've gotta talk to him.
- He's in China!

158
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,027
The country.

159
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,615
Wait, his flight doesn't leave
for 45 minutes.

160
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,409
What about the time difference?
From here to the airport?

161
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,661
Yes!

162
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,539
- You're never gonna make it!
- I've got to try.

163
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,667
What are you gonna say to him?

164
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,168
I don't know.

165
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,836
Maybe you shouldn't go.

166
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,923
Right, because if you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.

167
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,759
Yeah, but if it's good news, tell him now.

168
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,469
Maybe I'll know when I see him.

169
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,180
Here, look. All right, does this help?

170
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,021
No.

171
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:34,192
All I know is, I cannot wait a week.
This is just too big.

172
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,820
I've just got to talk to him. I've got...

173
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,406
- I'll see you later.
- I love you!

174
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,283
Deal with me first!

175
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:55,755
All right.

176
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,886
Ross! Ross.

177
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,179
Excuse me, pardon me.

178
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,848
- Hi. Your boarding pass?
- Hi.

179
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,891
No, I need to talk to my friend.

180
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:11,062
Sorry, you're not allowed on the jetway
unless you have a boarding pass.

181
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,482
He just went on. He's right there,
in the blue jacket! Can I just...?

182
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,651
I'm sorry. Federal regulations!

183
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,864
All right, um, then could you please
just give him a message for me?

184
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,615
Please? This is very important.

185
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,160
All right. What's the message?

186
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,871
Uh... I don't know.

187
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,792
Excuse me! Sir!
Excuse me! Sir?

188
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,919
- I have a message for you.
- What?

189
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:39,007
It's from Rachel. She loved the present.
She'll see you when you get back.

190
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,925
What?

191
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,054
Toby, I don't know
what she's talking about.

192
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,765
There's no Rachel!

193
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,142
Don't give me that deep freeze!

194
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:02,280
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

195
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,034
I think I blacked out there
for a minute.

196
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,162
It was nothing.

197
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,958
Well, now we gotta
find something fun for you!

198
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,672
Ahh, you know what?

199
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,594
Forget about me. Let's, uh...
Let's give you another turn.

200
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,431
Me, again?

201
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,975
Sure. Why not?

202
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:38,483
Boy! Somebody's gonna get
a big fruit basket tomorrow!

203
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:48,201
I gotta tell you, you are nothing like
I thought you would be.

204
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,744
How do you mean?

205
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:54,290
I just had you pegged as one of those
guys who are always, "Me, me, me!"

206
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,042
- Ha, ha.
- But you...

207
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,253
...you're a giver.

208
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,048
You're, like, the most generous
man I ever met.

209
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,718
I mean, you're practically a woman.

210
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,894
So, uh, Rach, do you want to save
this wrapping paper?

211
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,396
It's only a little torn.

212
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,941
Are you gonna go for it with Ross,
or should I throw it out?

213
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:26,030
I don't know.

214
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,200
Thought about it
all of the way there...

215
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,579
...and I thought about it
all the way back and, uh...

216
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,539
You know, it's Ross!

217
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,041
You know what I mean? It's Ross.

218
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,877
- Sure!
- Sure.

219
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:44,007
I don't know. This is just
my initial gut feeling...

220
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,885
...but I'm thinking...

221
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,053
...it'd be really great.

222
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,849
Oh, my God, me too!
Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law!

223
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,312
The best part is you already
know everything about him.

224
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,647
It's like starting on the 15th date.

225
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,318
But it would be like
starting on the 15th date.

226
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,112
Another good point.

227
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,906
No, I mean...

228
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:12,535
At the 15th date, you're already
in a "relationship-y" place.

229
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,953
You're committed.

230
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,040
Huh.

231
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,834
What happens if it doesn't work out?

232
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,046
- Why isn't it working out?
- I don't know, sometimes it doesn't.

233
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,966
Is he not cute enough for you?
Does he not make enough money?

234
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,344
- No, I'm just...
- Maybe there's someone else.

235
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,221
Is there? Is there someone else?

236
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,600
- No, there is no one else.
- Then why the hell...

237
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,186
...are you dumping my brother?
- Wha...?

238
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,989
- Hey, big...
- Shh!

239
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,908
Spender.

240
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,745
She's still asleep.

241
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,456
- So how'd it go?
- It was amazing.

242
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,708
You know how you think
you're great in bed?

243
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,587
The fact you'd even ask
shows how little you know me.

244
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,882
Well, it's like,
last night I couldn't do the thing...

245
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,009
...that usually makes me great.

246
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,345
So I had to do all this other stuff.

247
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,598
And the response I got! Man, oh, man.

248
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,976
It was like a ticker-tape parade!

249
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,564
Yes I know. As it happens, my room
is very close to the parade route.

250
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:33,032
It was amazing, and not just for her.
Uh-uh. For me too.

251
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,327
It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind...

252
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,705
...but all my other senses
are heightened.

253
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,542
You know? It's like,
I was able to appreciate it...

254
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,794
...on another level.

255
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,841
I didn't know you had another level.

256
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,176
I know. Neither did I!

257
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,938
- Hey, great skirts! Birthday present?
- Yeah.

258
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,732
- From who?
- From you.

259
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,067
I exchanged the blouse you got me.

260
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,362
Well, it's the thought.

261
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,699
Doesn't Ross' flight get in
in a couple hours?

262
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,743
At gate 27B?

263
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,871
Uh, yeah.

264
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,540
Monica, you know,
I've been thinking about it.

265
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,127
I've decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea.

266
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,171
- Why?
- Because I feel...

267
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,923
...like I wouldn't
just be going out with him.

268
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,217
I would be going out with all of you.

269
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:37,013
- Ugh, there'd be all this pressure and...
- No pressure, no pressure!

270
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,809
Nothing has even happened yet
and you're already so...

271
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,352
I'm not "so. "

272
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,772
I was a teensy bit weird at first...

273
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,858
...but I'll be good. I promise.

274
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,156
Who is it?

275
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,699
It's me, Carl.

276
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,992
Come on up.

277
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,952
Behind my brother's back?

278
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:05,249
Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.

279
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,141
- Seven hundred bucks.
- All right, you did it.

280
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,726
Do we have any fruit?

281
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,815
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh?

282
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:32,026
You know what, though?
I really feel I learned something.

283
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,862
So you'll stick with this
"it's all for her" thing?

284
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,864
What, are you crazy?

285
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:41,452
When a blind man gets his sight back,
does he walk around like this?

286
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,294
I'm just saying, if I see one more
picture of Ed Begley Jr...

287
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,547
...in that stupid electric car...

288
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,257
...I'm gonna shoot myself!

289
00:18:56,468 --> 00:19:00,221
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against
environmental issues, per se...

290
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,181
...it's just that guy!

291
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:06,602
I can't believe you'd rather
go out with him than me.

292
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,022
Excuse me, please.
I'm trying to have a date here.

293
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,692
Fine, just stop thinking about me.

294
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,406
Can't do it, can you?

295
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,534
So I'm thinking about you.
So what?

296
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,954
I don't get it. What do you see
in this guy anyway?

297
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,541
Well, he seems to be
a very nice guy.

298
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,878
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!

299
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,593
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.

300
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,220
- Ross, it's too hard.
- No, no.

301
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,347
Because it'll get weird
for everyone else?

302
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,725
Who cares about them? This is about us.

303
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:49,437
I've been in love with you
since the ninth grade.

304
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,190
- You're, like, my best friend.
- I know.

305
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,358
- If we broke up, and I lost you...
- Whoa.

306
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,402
Why do you think we'll break up?

307
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:00,489
Have you been involved with someone
where you haven't broken up?

308
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,702
No.

309
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,623
But it only has to happen once.

310
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:12,001
You and I know
we are perfect for each other.

311
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,419
Right?

312
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,298
So the only question is:
Are you attracted to me?

313
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,219
I don't know.

314
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,765
I mean, I've never looked at you
that way before.

315
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,142
Well start looking.

316
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,654
Wow.

317
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,072
Exactly!

318
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,199
And you just know
I'm gonna be the guy...

319
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,369
...caught behind this hammerhead
in traffic!

320
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,206
- Right.
- Heh.

321
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,083
You're right.

322
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,542
- You know what?
- What?

323
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,046
I forgot, I'm supposed to pick up
a friend at the airport.

324
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,382
I am so sorry. I'm so...

325
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,969
If you want to stay
and finish your drinks, please do.

326
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,596
I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry.

327
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,515
But...

328
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,943
Excuse me! Pardon me! Excuse me.

329
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,778
I'm sorry. Ha, ha.

330
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,823
Toby, for God's sake, will you let it go?

331
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,783
There's no Rachel!

332
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,791
- Oh, hey. I got that.
- Oh.

333
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,502
- Thanks, sweetie.
- No problem.

334
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,760
I cannot wait
for you to meet my friends.

335
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,513
Really? You don't think
they'll judge and ridicule me?

336
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,515
No, they will. I just, uh...

337
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,017
- Can't wait. Heh.
- Can't wait.

338
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,768
Come on, they're gonna love you.
