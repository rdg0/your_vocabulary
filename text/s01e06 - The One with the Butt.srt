1
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,884
Oh, look, look!
There's Joey's picture!

2
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,427
This is so exciting!

3
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:13,555
You can spot someone who's
never seen his plays.

4
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,308
Notice, no fear.
No sense of impending doom.

5
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,727
The exclamation point scares me.

6
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,230
It's not just <i>Freud,
</i>it's <i>Freud!</i>

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,358
ROSS:
Shh. Magic is about to happen!

8
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:26,985
JOEY:
Well, Eva...

9
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,864
...we've done
some excellent work here.

10
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,867
And I would have to say...

11
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,163
...your problem is quite clear.

12
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:43,210
<i>All you want is a dinkle</i>

13
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,463
<i>What you envy's a schwang</i>

14
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:50,008
<i>A thing through which you can tinkle</i>

15
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,886
<i>To play with or simply let hang</i>

16
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,405
I feel violated.

17
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,326
Did anybody else feel like
peeling their skin off...

18
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,453
...to have something else to do?

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,163
Ross, 10:00.

20
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,206
Is it? It feels like 2.

21
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,335
No, 10:00!

22
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:12,174
There's a beautiful woman
at 8, 9, 10:00!

23
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,510
ROSS:
Hello!

24
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:16,762
She's amazing!

25
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,599
She makes the women I dream about
look like short, fat, bald men.

26
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,518
Go over to her.
She's not with anyone.

27
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,562
And what would my opening line be?

28
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,813
Excuse me-

29
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,110
Come on, she's a person.
You can do it.

30
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,322
Could she be more out of my league?
Ross, back me up.

31
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,450
He could never get a woman
like that in a million years.

32
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:44,331
But you always see these beautiful
women with these "nothing" guys.

33
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,583
You could be one of those guys.

34
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,419
-You could do that.
-You think?

35
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,670
RACHEL:
Absolutely!

36
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,382
I can't believe
I'm even considering this.

37
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,218
-I'm very aware of my tongue.
-Come on.

38
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,677
Here goes.

39
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,059
Yes?

40
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,395
Hi. Urn- Ahem.

41
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,605
Okay, next word would be...

42
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:09,856
...uh, Chandler.

43
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,943
Chandler is my name and, uh....

44
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,737
Hi!

45
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,740
Yes, you said that.

46
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,952
Yes! Yes, I did.
But what I didn't say....

47
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,246
What I wanted to say was, uh...

48
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,666
...would you like to go out with me?
Thank you. Good night.

49
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,543
Chandler?

50
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,130
PHOEBE:
There he is!

51
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,425
ROSS: I didn't know you could dance!
RACHEL: You were in a play!

52
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,093
What'd you think?

53
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,139
ROSS: I didn't know you could dance!
RACHEL: You were in a play!

54
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,016
Come on, it wasn't that bad.
I was the lead.

55
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,478
It was better than the troll thing.
At least you got to see my head.

56
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,815
RACHEL: You're right.
ROSS: We saw your head.

57
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,567
She said yes! She said yes!

58
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,776
MONICA:
Wow!

59
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,362
Awful play, man! Whoa!

60
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:03,577
Her name's Aurora. She's Italian
and she pronounces my name "Chandler."

61
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,790
I like that better.
The usher gave me this to give to you.

62
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:12,085
-What is it?
-The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.

63
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,130
An agency left me its card.
Maybe they wanna sign me!

64
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,506
Based on this play?

65
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,136
Based on this play!

66
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,188
Hey, kids!

67
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,397
ROSS:
Hey, Chandler.

68
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:36,026
No, because this line is passion,
and this is just a line.

69
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:40,071
I've been here seven seconds, and you
haven't asked me how my date went.

70
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,742
How was your date, Chandler?

71
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,202
It was unbelievable!

72
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,039
I've never met anyone like her.
She's had the most amazing life!

73
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,916
CHANDLER:
<i>She was in the Israeli army.</i>

74
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,210
None of the bullets hit
the engine block...

75
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,837
...so we made it to the border.

76
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,964
But just barely and I....

77
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,969
I've been talking about myself
all night long. I'm sorry.

78
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,263
What about you?
Tell me your stories.

79
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,349
All right, once...

80
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,310
...once I got on the subway, right?

81
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,187
And it was at night...

82
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,065
...and I rode it
all the way to Brooklyn...

83
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,776
...just for the hell of it.

84
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,196
We talked till 2.
It was this perfect evening.

85
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,365
More or less.

86
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,951
Suddenly, we realized
we were in Yemen.

87
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,953
I'm sorry, so "we" is...?

88
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,080
"We" is me and Rick.

89
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,749
-Who's Rick?
-Who's Rick?

90
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,001
My husband.

91
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,336
ALL:
Ooh.

92
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,839
-Oh, so you're divorced?
-No.

93
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,052
I'm sorry. So you're widowed?
Hopefully?

94
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,721
No, I'm still married.

95
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,811
So how would your husband feel
about you sitting here with me...

96
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,480
...sliding your foot
so far up my leg...

97
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,233
...you can count
the change in my pocket?

98
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,194
Don't worry.

99
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,406
I imagine he'd be okay with you
because he's okay with Ethan.

100
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,368
Ethan? There's an Ethan?

101
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,454
Ethan is my...

102
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,914
...boyfriend.

103
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,332
ALL:
What?

104
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,337
So, uh, what kind of relationship
do you imagine us having...

105
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,132
...if you already have
a husband and a boyfriend?

106
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,552
I suppose, mainly sexual.

107
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:27,929
Huh.

108
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,807
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

109
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,311
What not work out?
I'm seeing her again on Thursday.

110
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,187
Didn't you listen to the story?

111
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,358
Didn't you listen to the story?

112
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,278
How could you get involved
with a woman like this?

113
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,948
I had trouble with it at first,
but I get all the good stuff.

114
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,577
All the fun, all the talking,
all the sex...

115
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,454
...and no responsibility.

116
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,874
This is every guy's fantasy!

117
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,627
That is not true.
Ross, is this your fantasy?

118
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,587
No, of course not.

119
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,716
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

120
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:09,137
You'd go out with someone else
who's going out with someone else?

121
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,472
I couldn't.

122
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,723
Good for you.

123
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,184
When I'm with a woman,
I need to know...

124
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,270
...that I'm going out
with more people than she is.

125
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,855
You know...

126
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:22,067
...monogamy can be a tricky concept.

127
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,610
I mean, anthropologically....

128
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,531
Fine. Now you'll never know.

129
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,367
We're kidding. Tell us.

130
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,202
MONICA: We wanna know.
JOEY: Come on!

131
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,206
All right. There's a theory
put forth by Richard Leakey-

132
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,341
Ta-da!

133
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,512
Are we greeting each other
this way now? I like that.

134
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,848
Look! I cleaned!

135
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,309
I did the windows.
I did the floors.

136
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,854
I used all the attachments on
the vacuum except for that round one.

137
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,481
I don't know what it's for.

138
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,900
Nobody knows, and we're
not supposed to ask.

139
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,319
RACHEL:
What do you think?

140
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,280
CHANDLER: It's very clean.
MONICA: Really, it looks great!

141
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:16,371
Oh. Heh.
I see you moved the green ottoman.

142
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,373
ROSS & PHOEBE:
Uh-oh.

143
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,793
How did that happen?

144
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,714
I don't know.
I thought it looked better there.

145
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:29,259
And also, it's an extra seat
around the coffee table.

146
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,803
Yeah, it's interesting.

147
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,473
But you know what? Just for fun...

148
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:39,436
...let's see what it looked like
in the old spot.

149
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,938
Just to compare.

150
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,648
Let's see. Ha!

151
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,734
Well, it looks good there too.

152
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,319
Let's leave it there for a while.

153
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,157
I can't believe you tried
to move the green ottoman.

154
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,493
Thank God you didn't
fan out the magazines.

155
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,579
She'll scratch your eyes out.

156
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,664
You guys, I am not that bad!

157
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,124
Yeah, you are.

158
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,043
Remember, I lived with you?

159
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,712
You were a little, you know....

160
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,426
That is so unfair!

161
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,472
When we were kids, yours was the only
Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.

162
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,935
Okay, so I'm responsible.
I'm organized.

163
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,979
But, hey, I can be a kook!

164
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,442
All right, you madcap gal!

165
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,361
Try to imagine this.

166
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,282
The phone bill arrives,
but you don't pay it right away.

167
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,118
-Why not?
-Because you're a kook!

168
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,998
Instead, you wait until
they send you a notice.

169
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,125
I could do that.

170
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:48,296
Okay, then you let me
go grocery shopping...

171
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,298
...and I buy laundry detergent.

172
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,968
But it's not the one
with the easy-pour spout.

173
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,804
Why would someone do that?

174
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,141
One might wonder.

175
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,102
A glass is on the table.
There's no coaster.

176
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,146
It's a cold drink. It's a hot day.

177
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:10,151
Beads of condensation are inching
their way closer to the wood....

178
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,444
Stop it!

179
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,449
Oh, my God!

180
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,827
It's true. Who am I?

181
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,371
Monica, you're Mom.

182
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,797
JOEY:
Uh-huh? Oh, my God!

183
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,049
Okay.

184
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,176
Okay, I'll be there.

185
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,139
That was my agent.

186
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:45,854
My agent has just gotten me a job
in the new Al Pacino movie!

187
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,648
CHANDLER:
Whoa! That's great!

188
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,024
What's the part?

189
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,277
Can you believe this?
Al Pacino!

190
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,362
This guy's why I became an actor.

191
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,906
"I'm out of order?
You're out of order!

192
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,993
This whole courtroom's out of order!"

193
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,704
Seriously, what's the part?

194
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:06,624
"Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in!"

195
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,003
Come on. Seriously,
Joey, what's the part?

196
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,548
You're, you're....
What?

197
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,511
I'm his butt double, okay?

198
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,476
I play Al Pacino's butt.

199
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,982
All right? He goes
into the shower, and then...

200
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,734
...I'm his butt.

201
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,819
Oh, my God!

202
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,279
Come on, you guys.

203
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,824
This is a real movie,
and Al Pacino's in it and that's big!

204
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,492
Oh, no, it's terrific.

205
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,912
After all your years of struggling...

206
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,332
...you've finally been able
to crack your way into show business.

207
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,879
Okay, fine.
Make jokes, I don't care.

208
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,547
This is a big break for me!

209
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,424
You're right. It is.

210
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,470
So are you gonna invite us all
to the big opening?

211
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,068
-I need to borrow some moisturizer.
-For what?

212
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,278
What do you think?
Today's the big day!

213
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,657
Okay, go into the bathroom.
Use whatever you want.

214
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,576
Just don't ever tell me
what you did in there.

215
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,078
JOEY:
Thank you.

216
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,124
-Joey's mom's on the phone.
-He's in the bathroom.

217
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,795
-You don't wanna go in there!
-Come on, we're roommates.

218
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,007
My eyes! My eyes!

219
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,053
MONICA:
I warned you.

220
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,097
Who is being loud?

221
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,307
Oh, that would be Monica.

222
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,644
Can I borrow some things?
I wanna make Aurora breakfast.

223
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,646
You got the whole night, huh?

224
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,191
Well, I only have 20 minutes
until Ethan, so....

225
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,360
Do I sense a bit of resentment?

226
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,697
No, no, no. No resentment.
Believe me...

227
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,032
...it's worth it, okay?

228
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,451
In a relationship,
you have these key moments...

229
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,121
...you'll remember
for the rest of your life.

230
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,582
Well, every single second
is like that with Aurora.

231
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,335
And I've just wasted
35 of them talking to you.

232
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,797
So, uh, Monica, can you
help me with the door?

233
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,509
Um, Chandler, you know, the old Monica
would remind you...

234
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:25,513
...to scrub that Teflon pan
with a plastic brush.

235
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,850
But I'm not gonna do that.

236
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,983
DIRECTOR:
Damn it! Hire the girl.

237
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,319
Okay, everybody ready?

238
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,740
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you
for this great opportunity.

239
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,034
Lose the robe.

240
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,161
Me?

241
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,662
That would work.

242
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,041
Right. Okay.
Losing the robe!

243
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,502
Okay, and the robe is lost.

244
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,089
Everybody, I would like
to get this in one take.

245
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,632
Let's roll it.

246
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,259
Water's working.

247
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,845
And action!

248
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,348
And cut!

249
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,642
Butt guy, what are you doing?

250
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,354
I'm showering.

251
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,355
No, that was clenching.

252
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,985
Well, the way I see it,
the guy's upset here, you know?

253
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,488
His wife's dead,
his brother's missing.

254
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,407
I think his butt would be angry here.

255
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,078
I think his butt would like
to get the shot before lunch.

256
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,915
Once again, rolling.
Water working.

257
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,834
And action!

258
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,588
And cut! What was that?

259
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,300
I was going for quiet desperation.

260
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,513
But if you have to ask....

261
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,063
God, I love these fingers.

262
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,481
Thank you.

263
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,234
No, actually, I meant my fingers.

264
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,779
Look at them.
Look at how happy they are.

265
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,826
-Oh, my God, I'm late!
-Oh, no, no, no.

266
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,995
-Don't go, don't go.
-Okay, okay.

267
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,915
-I have to.
-Look, she's leaving.

268
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,210
I'm sorry.
He'll be waiting for me.

269
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,045
I thought you talked to Rick.

270
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,172
It's not Rick.

271
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,508
Ethan? He gets
the whole day with you!

272
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,427
No, it's Andrew.

273
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,017
I know there'll be many moments...

274
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,563
...when I'll regret asking
the following question, but....

275
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,815
And Andrew is...?

276
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,151
He's...new.

277
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,656
So you're not completely fulfilled
by Rick, Ethan and myself?

278
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,325
No, that's not exactly what I was-

279
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,369
Most women would kill...

280
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,663
...for three guys like us.

281
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,416
So, what do you want?

282
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,168
You.

283
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,212
-You have me.
-No, no. Just you.

284
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:04,630
What do you mean?

285
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,716
Lose the other guys.

286
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,469
Like, all of them?

287
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,140
Come on, we're great together.
Why not?

288
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,517
Why can't we just have
what we have now?

289
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,061
Why can't we just talk,
laugh and make love...

290
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,106
...without feeling obligated
to one another?

291
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:26,110
Up until tonight, I thought
that's what you wanted too.

292
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,238
Well, part of me wants that...

293
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,657
...but it's like I'm two guys.

294
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,869
I mean, one guy's saying,
"Shut up! This is great!"

295
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,747
But there's this other guy.

296
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,958
It's the guy who wells up
every time the Grinch's heart...

297
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,045
...grows three sizes
and breaks that measuring device.

298
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,841
He's saying, you know,
"This is too hard. Get out, get out!"

299
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,553
So which one of the two guys
will you listen to?

300
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:57,350
I have to listen to both.
They don't let each other finish.

301
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,061
Which one?

302
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,024
The second guy.

303
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,902
I see.

304
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,909
Call me if you change your mind.

305
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,796
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.

306
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,520
Look at it this way.
You dumped her!

307
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,148
Right? I mean, this woman was...

308
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,984
...unbelievably sexy...

309
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,570
...and beautiful,
intelligent, unattainable....

310
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,783
Tell me why you did this again?

311
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,952
ROSS: Hey!
MONICA: Hey!

312
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,620
RACHEL:
Movie star!

313
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:03,499
Aren't you the guy who plays
the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?

314
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:06,711
Nope.

315
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,547
No? What happened, big guy?

316
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,215
Big guy?

317
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,595
It felt like a "big guy" moment.

318
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:17,596
I got fired!

319
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,766
They said I acted too much with it.

320
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,438
I told everybody about this.

321
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,607
Everybody will be
expecting to see me.

322
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,401
You know what?
No one will be able to tell.

323
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,278
My mom will.

324
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,282
There's something so sweet...

325
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,743
...and disturbing about that.

326
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,955
I've done nothing
but crappy plays for six years...

327
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,208
...and I finally get my shot,
and I blow it!

328
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,169
Maybe this wasn't your shot.

329
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:52,923
I think when it's your shot,
you know it's your shot.

330
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,052
Did it feel like your shot?

331
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,056
Hard to tell. I was naked.

332
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,891
I don't think this was your shot.

333
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,393
I don't even think
you just get one shot.

334
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,980
I really believe big things are
gonna happen for you. I do.

335
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,109
You've gotta keep thinking about
the day that some kid will go...

336
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,988
..."I got the part! I'm gonna be
Joey Tribbiani's ass!"

337
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,911
You think? That's so nice.

338
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,705
Oh, come here.

339
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,836
I'm sorry, Joey.
I'm gonna go to bed, guys.

340
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,129
ROSS:
Good night.

341
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,715
RACHEL: You're gonna leave
your shoes out here?

342
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,344
Uh-huh.

343
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,182
Really? Just casually
strewn about...

344
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,684
...in that reckless,
haphazard manner?

345
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:51,315
It doesn't matter.
I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!

346
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,235
Whenever.

347
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,657
She is a kook.

348
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:17,466
MONICA: <i>If it bothers you
that much, just go out and get the shoes.</i>

349
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,637
<i>No, don't do this!</i>

350
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,305
<i>This is stupid!</i>

351
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,642
<i>/ don't have to prove anything.
I'm gonna go get them.</i>

352
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,186
<i>But then everyone will know.</i>

353
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:34,984
<i>Unless I get them, and then wake up
really early and put them back.</i>

354
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,944
<i>/ need help!</i>
